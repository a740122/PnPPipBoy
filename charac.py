traits=[['Kamikaze','''By not paying attention to any threats,
you can act a lot faster in a turn.
This lowers your Armor Class to just
what you are wearing, but you sequence
much faster in a combat turn. You have
no natural Armor Class (Armor Class is 
12
therefore 0 regardless of Agility). You
must wear armor to get an Armor Class.
Your sequence gets a 5 point bonus.'''],['One Hander','''One of your hands is very dominant. You
excel with single-handed weapons, but
two-handed weapons cause a problem. You
have a 40% penalty to hit with twohanded
weapons, but get a 20% bonus to
hit with weapons that only require one
hand. Animals cannot choose this trait.''']]
